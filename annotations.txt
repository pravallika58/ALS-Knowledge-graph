36116464|t|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
36116464|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal CNS neurodegenerative disease. Despite intensive research, current management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains suboptimal from diagnosis to prognosis. Recognition of the phenotypic heterogeneity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, global CNS dysfunction, genetic architecture, and development of novel diagnostic criteria is clarifying the spectrum of clinical presentation and facilitating diagnosis. Insights into the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, identification of disease biomarkers and modifiable risks, along with new predictive models, scales, and scoring systems, and a clinical trial pipeline of mechanism-based therapies, are changing the prognostic landscape. Although most recent advances have yet to translate into patient benefit, the idea of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a complex syndrome is already having tangible effects in the clinic. This Seminar will outline these insights and discuss the status of the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for the general neurologist, along with future prospects that could improve care and outcomes for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

36012563|t|Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Proteomics Spotlight on ALS and Parkinson's Disease.
36012563|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both characterized by pathogenic protein aggregates that correlate with the progressive degeneration of neurons and the loss of behavioral functions. Both diseases lack biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Proteomics is an unbiased quantitative tool capable of the high throughput quantitation of thousands of proteins from minimal sample volumes. We review recent proteomic studies in human tissues, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and exosomes in ALS and PD that identify proteins with potential utility as biomarkers. Further, we review disease-related post-translational modifications in key proteins TDP43 in ALS and alpha-synuclein in PD studies, which may serve as biomarkers. We compare relative and absolute quantitative proteomic approaches in key biomarker studies in ALS and PD and discuss recent technological advancements which may identify suitable biomarkers for the early-diagnosis treatment efficacy of these diseases.

35653060|t|Antisense Oligonucleotides for the Study and Treatment of ALS.
35653060|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. ALS is now associated with mutations in numerous genes, many of which cause disease in part through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are small sequences of DNA that can reduce expression of a target gene at the post-transcriptional level, making them attractive for neutralizing mutant or toxic gene products. Advancements in the medicinal chemistries of ASOs have improved their pharmacodynamic profile to allow safe and effective delivery to the central nervous system. ASO therapies for ALS have rapidly developed over the last two decades, and ASOs that target SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and ATXN2 are now in clinical trials for familial or sporadic forms of ALS. This review discusses the current state of ASO therapies for ALS, outlining their successes from preclinical development to early clinical trials.

35120619|t|iPSC-based disease modeling and drug discovery in cardinal neurodegenerative disorders.
35120619|a|It has been 15 years since the birth of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology in 2007, and the scope of its application has been expanding. In addition to the development of cell therapies using iPSC-derived cells, pathological analyses using disease-specific iPSCs and clinical trials to confirm the safety and efficacy of drugs developed using iPSCs are progressing. With the innovation of related technologies, iPSC applications are about to enter a new stage. This review outlines advances in iPSC modeling and therapeutic development for cardinal neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

26409694|t|Supporting communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease.
26409694|a|BACKGROUND: Communication supports, referred to as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), are an integral part of medical speech-language pathology practice, yet many providers remain unfamiliar with assessment and intervention principles. For patients with complex communication impairments secondary to neurodegenerative disease, AAC services differ depending on whether their condition primarily affects speech and motor skills (ALS), language (primary progressive aphasia) or cognition (Alzheimer's disease). This review discusses symptom management for these three conditions, identifying behavioral strategies, low- and high-tech solutions for implementation during the natural course of disease. These AAC principles apply to all neurodegenerative diseases in which common symptoms appear. OBJECTIVES: To present AAC interventions for patients with neurodegenerative diseases affecting speech, motor, language and cognitive domains. Three themes emerge: (1) timing of intervention: early referral, regular re-evaluations and continual treatment are essential; (2) communication partners must be included from the onset to establish AAC acceptance and use; and (3) strategies will change over time and use multiple modalities to capitalize on patients' strengths. CONCLUSIONS: AAC should be standard practice for adults with neurodegenerative disease. Patients can maintain effective, functional communication with AAC supports. Individualized communication systems can be implemented ensuring patients remain active participants in daily activities.

32383122|t|Studying ALS: Current Approaches, Effect on Potential Treatment Strategy.
32383122|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by inevitable progressive paralysis. To date, only two disease modifying therapeutic options are available for the patients with ALS, although they show very modest effect on disease course. The main reason of failure in the field of pharmacological correction of ALS is inability to untangle complex relationships taking place during ALS initiation and progression. Traditional methods of research, based on morphology or transgenic animal models studying provided lots of information about ALS throughout the years. However, translation of these results to humans was unsuccessful due to incomplete recapitulation of molecular pathology and overall inadequacy of the models used in the research.In this review we summarize current knowledge regarding ALS molecular pathology with depiction of novel methods applied recently for the studies. Furthermore we describe present and potential treatment strategies that are based on the recent findings in ALS disease mechanisms.

34099897|t|Molecular mechanisms of cell death in neurological diseases.
34099897|a|Tightly orchestrated programmed cell death (PCD) signalling events occur during normal neuronal development in a spatially and temporally restricted manner to establish the neural architecture and shaping the CNS. Abnormalities in PCD signalling cascades, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cell death associated with autophagy as well as in unprogrammed necrosis can be observed in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. These cell deaths can be activated in response to various forms of cellular stress (exerted by intracellular or extracellular stimuli) and inflammatory processes. Aberrant activation of PCD pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Conversely, inactivation of PCD is thought to contribute to the development of brain cancers and to impact their response to therapy. For many neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers current treatment strategies have only modest effect, engendering the need for investigations into the origins of these diseases. With many diseases of the brain displaying aberrations in PCD pathways, it appears that agents that can either inhibit or induce PCD may be critical components of future therapeutic strategies. The development of such therapies will have to be guided by preclinical studies in animal models that faithfully mimic the human disease. In this review, we briefly describe PCD and unprogrammed cell death processes and the roles they play in contributing to neurodegenerative diseases or tumorigenesis in the brain. We also discuss the interplay between distinct cell death signalling cascades and disease pathogenesis and describe pharmacological agents targeting key players in the cell death signalling pathways that have progressed through to clinical trials.

33781562|t|Therapeutic news in ALS.
33781562|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by death of motor neurons in the cortex and the spinal cord. This loss of motor neurons causes progressive weakness and amyotrophy. To date, the median duration of survival in patients with ALS, from first symptoms to death, is estimated to be 36 months. Currently the treatment is limited to two options: riluzole which prolongs survival for a few months and edaravone which is available in only a few countries and also has a small impact on disease progression. There is an urgent need for more effective drugs in this disease to significantly improve progression. Over the last 30 years, all trials have failed to find a curative drug for ALS. This is due, partially, to the heterogeneity of the clinical features and the pathophysiology of motor neuron death. We present in this review the various treatment options currently being developed for ALS, with an emphasis on the range of therapeutic approaches being explored, from old drugs tested in a new indication to innovative drugs obtained via biotechnology or gene therapy.

24510737|t|Rehabilitation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: why it matters.
24510737|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that results in a constellation of problematic symptoms and a high patient and caregiver burden. Multidisciplinary care includes rehabilitation interventions that have the goal of assisting people to teach their fullest potential despite the presence of a disabling disease. Given the progressive nature of ALS, the clinician must be aware of the expected disease trajectory and apply appropriate interventions at each stage. This review will present rehabilitation strategies that can be utilized to maximize patient independence, function, safety, and quality of life, and to minimize disease-related symptoms. The role of bracing, exercise, assistive devices, and adaptive equipment will be discussed. At each disease stage, an experienced rehabilitation team is well positioned to make a significant impact on the life of ALS patients.

32344649|t|Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-Based Neurodegenerative Disease Models for Phenotype Recapitulation and Drug Screening.
32344649|a|Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant unmet medical need in our aging society. There are no effective treatments for most of these diseases, and we know comparatively little regarding pathogenic mechanisms. Among the challenges faced by those involved in developing therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, the syndromes are often complex, and small animal models do not fully recapitulate the unique features of the human nervous system. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a novel technology that ideally would permit us to generate neuronal cells from individual patients, thereby eliminating the problem of species-specificity inherent when using animal models. Specific phenotypes of iPSC-derived cells may permit researchers to identify sub-types and to distinguish among unique clusters and groups. Recently, iPSCs were used for drug screening and testing for neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinocerebellar atrophy (SCA), and Zika virus infection. However, there remain many challenges still ahead, including how one might effectively recapitulate sporadic disease phenotypes and the selection of ideal phenotypes and for large-scale drug screening. Fortunately, quite a few novel strategies have been developed that might be combined with an iPSC-based model to solve these challenges, including organoid technology, single-cell RNA sequencing, genome editing, and deep learning artificial intelligence. Here, we will review current applications and potential future directions for iPSC-based neurodegenerative disease models for critical drug screening.

36543887|t|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a neurodegenerative disorder poised for successful therapeutic translation.
36543887|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease caused by degeneration of motor neurons. As with all major neurodegenerative disorders, development of disease-modifying therapies has proven challenging for multiple reasons. Nevertheless, ALS is one of the few neurodegenerative diseases for which disease-modifying therapies are approved. Significant discoveries and advances have been made in ALS preclinical models, genetics, pathology, biomarkers, imaging and clinical readouts over the last 10-15 years. At the same time, novel therapeutic paradigms are being applied in areas of high unmet medical need, including neurodegenerative disorders. These developments have evolved our knowledge base, allowing identification of targeted candidate therapies for ALS with diverse mechanisms of action. In this Review, we discuss how this advanced knowledge, aligned with new approaches, can enable effective translation of therapeutic agents from preclinical studies through to clinical benefit for patients with ALS. We anticipate that this approach in ALS will also positively impact the field of drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders more broadly.

Here, we present recent advances, with a focus on histone modifications and the implications for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We highlight common and unique epigenetic mechanisms among these situations and point to emerging therapeutic approaches.

35659112|t|Tauroursodeoxycholic acid: a potential therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative diseases.
35659112|a|Most neurodegenerative disorders are diseases of protein homeostasis, with misfolded aggregates accumulating. The neurodegenerative process is mediated by numerous metabolic pathways, most of which lead to apoptosis. In recent years, hydrophilic bile acids, particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), have shown important anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities, with numerous experimental and clinical evidence suggesting their possible therapeutic use as disease-modifiers in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental evidence on the mechanisms underlying TUDCA's neuroprotective action derives from animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia. Preclinical studies indicate that TUDCA exerts its effects not only by regulating and inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, but also by reducing oxidative stress, protecting the mitochondria, producing an anti-neuroinflammatory action, and acting as a chemical chaperone to maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. Furthermore, data from phase II clinical trials have shown TUDCA to be safe and a potential disease-modifier in ALS. ALS is the first neurodegenerative disease being treated with hydrophilic bile acids. While further clinical evidence is being accumulated for the other diseases, TUDCA stands as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

28461024|t|Care management in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
28461024|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive weakness of voluntary muscles of movement as well as those for swallowing, speech and respiration. In the absence of curative treatment, care can improve quality of life, prolong survival, and support ALS patients and their families, and also help them to anticipate and prepare for the end of life. Multidisciplinary management in tertiary centers is recommended in close collaboration with general practitioners, home carers and a dedicated health network. Patients' follow-up deals mainly with motor impairment and physical disability, adaptation, nutrition and respiratory function. Involvement of palliative care as part of the multidisciplinary team management offers patients the possibility of discussing their end of life issues. This review summarizes the different aspects of ALS care, from delivering the diagnosis to the end of life, and the organization of its management.

35942674|t|Biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
35942674|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, devastating neurodegenerative disease. Still, the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, and the treatment options are strongly limited. However, the pipeline of potential treatments currently tested in clinical trials is promising. This review will discuss developments in ALS biomarker research and applications within the last 2 years and suggest future directions and needs. RECENT FINDINGS: The diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments, a general marker for axoneuronal degeneration, has been confirmed by further studies in patients with ALS, and neurofilaments are finding their way into routine diagnostic and clinical trials. Additionally, there have been advancements in developing and implementing disease-specific biomarkers, especially in patients with a genetic variant, such as SOD1 or C9orf72. Here, biomarkers have already been used as target markers and outcome parameters for novel treatment approaches. In addition, several novel biomarkers have shown encouraging results but should be discussed in the context of their early stage of assay and clinical establishment. SUMMARY: The first biomarkers have found their way into clinical routine in ALS. In light of an increasing pipeline of potential treatments, further progress in discovering and implementing novel and existing biomarkers is crucial.

35039149|t|Progranulin as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.
35039149|a|Progranulin (PGRN, encoded by the GRN gene) plays a key role in the development, survival, function, and maintenance of neurons and microglia in the mammalian brain. It regulates lysosomal biogenesis, inflammation, repair, stress response, and aging. GRN loss-of-function mutations cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or frontotemporal dementia-GRN (FTD-GRN) in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Mutations that reduce PGRN levels increase the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and limbic-predominant age-related transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy, as well as exacerbate the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and FTD caused by the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. Elevating and/or restoring PGRN levels is an attractive therapeutic strategy and is being investigated for neurodegenerative diseases through multiple mechanisms of action.

28317317|t|The neuroprotective effects of caffeine in neurodegenerative diseases.
28317317|a|Caffeine is the most widely used psychostimulant in Western countries, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), caffeine is beneficial in both men and women, in humans and animals. Similar effects of caffeine were observed in men with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the effect of caffeine in female PD patients is controversial due to caffeine's competition with estrogen for the estrogen-metabolizing enzyme, CYP1A2. Studies conducted in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showed protective effects of A2A R antagonism. A study found caffeine to be associated with earlier age of onset of Huntington's disease (HD) at intakes >190 mg/d, but studies in animal models have found equivocal results. Caffeine is protective in AD and PD at dosages equivalent to 3-5 mg/kg. However, further research is needed to investigate the effects of caffeine on PD in women. As well, the effects of caffeine in ALS, HD and Machado-Joseph disease need to be further investigated. Caffeine's most salient mechanisms of action relevant to neurodegenerative diseases need to be further explored.

31441732|t|Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Potentials, Advances and Limitations.
31441732|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive and uncontrolled gradual loss of motor neurons function or death of neuron cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and the mechanisms underlying their progressive nature remain elusive. There is urgent need to investigate therapeutic strategies and novel treatments for neural regeneration in disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, the development and identification of pluripotent stem cells enabling the acquisition of a large number of neural cells in order to improve cell recovery after neurodegenerative disorders. Pluripotent stem cells which consist of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are characterized by their ability to indefinitely self-renew and the capacity to differentiate into different types of cells. The first human ESC lines were established from donated human embryos; while, because of a limited supply of donor embryos, human ESCs derivation remains ethically and politically controversial. Hence, hiPSCs-based therapies have been shown as an effective replacement for human ESCs without embryo destruction. Compared to the invasive methods for derivation of human ESCs, human iPSCs has opened possible to reprogram patient-specific cells by defined factors and with minimally invasive procedures. Human pluripotent stem cells are a good source for cell-based research, cell replacement therapies and disease modeling. To date, hundreds of human ESC and human iPSC lines have been generated with the aim of treating various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we have highlighted the recent potentials, advances, and limitations of human pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

35585374|t|Design of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Trial of Tofersen Initiated in Clinically Presymptomatic SOD1 Variant Carriers: the ATLAS Study.
35585374|a|Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.

34995492|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive cell loss leading to disruption of the structure and function of the central nervous system. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was among the first of these disorders modeled in patient-specific iPSCs, and recent findings have translated into some of the earliest iPSC-inspired clinical trials. Focusing on ALS as an example, we evaluate the status of modeling neurodegenerative diseases using iPSCs, including methods for deriving and using disease-relevant neuronal and glial lineages. We further highlight the remaining challenges in exploiting the full potential of iPSC technology for understanding and potentially treating neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS.

35275534|t|Investigating Casual Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Metabolites, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
35275534|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies had explored that gut microbiota was associated with neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) through the gut-brain axis, among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the underlying causality remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate potential causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases through Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. METHODS: We selected genetic variants associated with gut microbiota traits (N = 18,340) and gut microbiota-derived metabolites (N = 7,824) from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from IGAP (AD, 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls), IPDGC (PD, 37,688 cases; 141,779 controls), and IALSC (ALS, 20,806 cases; 59,804 controls) respectively. RESULTS: Greater abundance of Ruminococcus (OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.103-1.405; p = 0.0004) was found significantly related to higher risk of ALS. Besides, our study found suggestive associations of Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and Lachnoclostridium with AD, of Lentisphaerae, Lentisphaeria, Oxalobacteraceae, Victivallales, Bacillales, Eubacteriumhalliigroup, Anaerostipes, and Clostridiumsensustricto1 with PD, and of Lachnospira, Fusicatenibacter, Catenibacterium, and Ruminococcusgnavusgroup with ALS. Our study also revealed suggestive associations between 12 gut microbiome-dependent metabolites and neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamine was related to lower risk of AD. For the serotonin pathway, serotonin was found as a protective factor of PD, while kynurenine as a risk factor for ALS.

36674643|t|Gene Therapy in ALS and SMA: Advances, Challenges and Perspectives.
36674643|a|Gene therapy is defined as the administration of genetic material to modify, manipulate gene expression or alter the properties of living cells for therapeutic purposes. Recent advances and improvements in this field have led to many breakthroughs in the treatment of various diseases. As a result, there has been an increasing interest in the use of these therapies to treat motor neuron diseases (MNDs), for which many potential molecular targets have been discovered. MNDs are neurodegenerative disorders that, in their most severe forms, can lead to respiratory failure and death, for instance, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite the fact that SMA has been known for many years, it is still one of the most common genetic diseases causing infant mortality. The introduction of drugs based on ASOs-nusinersen; small molecules-risdiplam; and replacement therapy (GRT)-Zolgensma has shown a significant improvement in both event-free survival and the quality of life of patients after using these therapies in the available trial results. Although there is still no drug that would effectively alleviate the course of the disease in ALS, the experience gained from SMA gene therapy gives hope for a positive outcome of the efforts to produce an effective and safe drug. The aim of this review is to present current progress and prospects for the use of gene therapy in the treatment of both SMA and ALS.

30576920|t|NRF2 and NF-kB interplay in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches.
30576920|a|Electrophiles and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in modulating cellular defense mechanisms as well as physiological functions, and intracellular signaling. However, excessive ROS generation (endogenous and exogenous) can create a state of redox imbalance leading to cellular and tissue damage (Ma and He, 2012) [1]. A growing body of research data strongly suggests that imbalanced ROS and electrophile overproduction are among the major prodromal factors in the onset and progression of several cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and aging (Ma and He, 2012; Ramsey et al., 2017; Salminen et al., 2012; Sandberg et al., 2014; Sarlette et al., 2008; Tanji et al., 2013) [1-6]. Cells offset oxidative stress by the action of housekeeping antioxidative enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) as well direct and indirect antioxidants (Dinkova-Kostova and Talalay, 2010) [7]. The DNA sequence responsible for modulating the antioxidative and cytoprotective responses of the cells has been identified as the antioxidant response element (ARE), while the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) is the major regulator of the xenobiotic-activated receptor (XAR) responsible for activating the ARE-pathway, thus defined as the NRF2-ARE system (Ma and He, 2012) [1]. In addition, the interplay between the NRF2-ARE system and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB, a protein complex that controls cytokine production and cell survival), has been further investigated in relation to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. On these premises, we provide a review analysis of current understanding of the NRF2-NF-kB interplay, their specific role in major CNS disorders, and consequent therapeutic implication for the treatment of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.

31234550|t|The Potential of Flavonoids for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
31234550|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), currently affect more than 6 million people in the United States. Unfortunately, there are no treatments that slow or prevent disease development and progression. Regardless of the underlying cause of the disorder, age is the strongest risk factor for developing these maladies, suggesting that changes that occur in the aging brain put it at increased risk for neurodegenerative disease development. Moreover, since there are a number of different changes that occur in the aging brain, it is unlikely that targeting a single change is going to be effective for disease treatment. Thus, compounds that have multiple biological activities that can impact the various age-associated changes in the brain that contribute to neurodegenerative disease development and progression are needed. The plant-derived flavonoids have a wide range of activities that could make them particularly effective for blocking the age-associated toxicity pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the evidence for beneficial effects of multiple flavonoids in models of AD, PD, HD, and ALS is presented and common mechanisms of action are identified. Overall, the preclinical data strongly support further investigation of specific flavonoids for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

33652720|t|PERK Pathway and Neurodegenerative Disease: To Inhibit or to Activate?
33652720|a|With the extension of life span in recent decades, there is an increasing burden of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, for which effective treatments are lacking. Neurodegenerative diseases include the widespread Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the less frequent Huntington's disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and also rare early-onset diseases linked to mutations that cause protein aggregation or loss of function in genes that maintain protein homeostasis. The difficulties in applying gene therapy approaches to tackle these diseases is drawing increasing attention to strategies that aim to inhibit cellular toxicity and restore homeostasis by intervening in cellular pathways. These include the unfolded protein response (UPR), activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular affliction that is shared by these diseases. Special focus is turned to the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of the UPR as a target for intervention. However, the complexity of the pathway and its ability to promote cell survival or death, depending on ER stress resolution, has led to some confusion in conflicting studies. Both inhibition and activation of the PERK pathway have been reported to be beneficial in disease models, although there are also some reports where they are counterproductive. Although with the current knowledge a definitive answer cannot be given on whether it is better to activate or to inhibit the pathway, the most encouraging strategies appear to rely on boosting some steps without compromising downstream recovery.

26423934|t|Reverse engineering human neurodegenerative disease using pluripotent stem cell technology.
26423934|a|With the technology of reprogramming somatic cells by introducing defined transcription factors that enables the generation of "induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)" with pluripotency comparable to that of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it has become possible to use this technology to produce various cells and tissues that have been difficult to obtain from living bodies. This advancement is bringing forth rapid progress in iPSC-based disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. More and more studies have demonstrated that phenotypes of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders could be rather faithfully recapitulated in iPSC-derived neural cell cultures. Moreover, despite the adult-onset nature of the diseases, pathogenic phenotypes and cellular abnormalities often exist in early developmental stages, providing new "windows of opportunity" for understanding mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders and for discovering new medicines. The cell reprogramming technology enables a reverse engineering approach for modeling the cellular degenerative phenotypes of a wide range of human disorders. An excellent example is the study of the human neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using iPSCs. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs), culminating in muscle wasting and death from respiratory failure. The iPSC approach provides innovative cell culture platforms to serve as ALS patient-derived model systems. Researchers have converted iPSCs derived from ALS patients into MNs and various types of glial cells, all of which are involved in ALS, to study the disease. The iPSC technology could be used to determine the role of specific genetic factors to track down what's wrong in the neurodegenerative disease process in the "disease-in-a-dish" model. Meanwhile, parallel experiments of targeting the same specific genes in human ESCs could also be performed to control and to complement the iPSC-based approach for ALS disease modeling studies. Much knowledge has been generated from the study of both ALS iPSCs and ESCs. As these methods have advantages and disadvantages that should be balanced on experimental design in order for them to complement one another, combining the diverse methods would help build an expanded knowledge of ALS pathophysiology. The goals are to reverse engineer the human disease using ESCs and iPSCs, generate lineage reporter lines and in vitro disease models, target disease related genes, in order to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of differentiation regulation along neural (neuronal versus glial) lineages, to unravel the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease, and to provide appropriate cell sources for replacement therapy. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: PSC and the brain.

32230811|t|Role of Alcohol Drinking in Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
32230811|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), increase as the population ages around the world. Environmental factors also play an important role in most cases. Alcohol consumption exists extensively and it acts as one of the environmental factors that promotes these neurodegenerative diseases. The brain is a major target for the actions of alcohol, and heavy alcohol consumption has long been associated with brain damage. Chronic alcohol intake leads to elevated glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and permanent neuronal damage associated with malnutrition. The relationship and contributing mechanisms of alcohol with these three diseases are different. Epidemiological studies have reported a reduction in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in individuals who drink low amounts of alcohol; low or moderate concentrations of ethanol protect against beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity in hippocampal neurons; and excessive amounts of ethanol increase accumulation of Abeta and Tau phosphorylation. Alcohol has been suggested to be either protective of, or not associated with, PD. However, experimental animal studies indicate that chronic heavy alcohol consumption may have dopamine neurotoxic effects through the induction of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and an increase in the amount of alpha-Synuclein (alphaSYN) relevant to PD. The findings on the association between alcohol consumption and ALS are inconsistent; a recent population-based study suggests that alcohol drinking seems to not influence the risk of developing ALS. Additional research is needed to clarify the potential etiological involvement of alcohol intake in causing or resulting in major neurodegenerative diseases, which will eventually lead to potential therapeutics against these alcoholic neurodegenerative diseases.

34677606|t|Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases.
34677606|a|Significant progress has been made in understanding the pre-symptomatic phase of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While much is still unknown, advances in other neurodegenerative diseases offer valuable insights. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that the well-recognized clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), spinal muscular atrophy, and frontotemporal dementia are also each preceded by a pre-symptomatic or prodromal period of varying duration, during which the underlying disease process unfolds, with associated compensatory changes and loss of inherent system redundancy. Key insights from these diseases highlight opportunities for discovery in ALS. The development of biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau has led to a shift in defining AD based on inferred underlying histopathology. PD is unique among neurodegenerative diseases in the number and diversity of non-genetic biomarkers of pre-symptomatic disease, most notably REM-sleep behavior disorder. HD benefits from an ability to predict the likely timing of clinically manifest disease based on age and CAG-repeat length alongside reliable neuroimaging markers of atrophy. SMA clinical trials have highlighted the transformational value of early therapeutic intervention, and studies in FTD illustrate the differential role of biomarkers based on genotype. Similar advances in ALS would transform our understanding of key events in pathogenesis, thereby dramatically accelerating progress towards disease prevention. Deciphering the biology of pre-symptomatic ALS relies upon a clear conceptual framework for defining the earliest stages of disease. Clinically manifest ALS may emerge abruptly, especially among those who harbor genetic mutations associated with rapidly progressive ALS. However, the disease may also evolve more gradually, revealing a prodromal period of mild motor impairment preceding phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Similarly, cognitive and behavioral impairment, when present, may emerge gradually, evolving through a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment or mild behavioral impairment before progression to ALS. Biomarkers are critically important to studying pre-symptomatic ALS and essential to efforts to intervene therapeutically before clinically manifest disease emerges. The use of non-genetic biomarkers, however, presents challenges related to counseling, informed consent, communication of results, and limited protections afforded by existing legislation. Experiences from pre-symptomatic genetic testing and counseling, and the legal protections against discrimination based on genetic data, may serve as a guide. Building upon what we have learned-more broadly from other pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases and specifically from ALS gene mutation carriers-we present a roadmap to early intervention, and perhaps even disease prevention, for all forms of ALS.

33918092|t|The Links between ALS and NF-kappaB.
33918092|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease wherein motor neuron degeneration leads to muscle weakness, progressive paralysis, and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Currently, the cause of ALS is unknown but, as with several neurodegenerative diseases, the potential role of neuroinflammation has become an increasingly popular hypothesis in ALS research. Indeed, upregulation of neuroinflammatory factors have been observed in both ALS patients and animal models. One such factor is the inflammatory inducer NF-kappaB. Besides its connection to inflammation, NF-kappaB activity can be linked to several genes associated to familial forms of ALS, and many of the environmental risk factors of the disease stimulate NF-kappaB activation. Collectively, this has led many to hypothesize that NF-kappaB proteins may play a role in ALS pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the genetic and environmental connections between NF-kappaB and ALS, as well as how this pathway may affect different CNS cell types, and finally how this may lead to motor neuron degeneration.

28856541|t|Glycoprotein NMB: an Emerging Role in Neurodegenerative Disease.
28856541|a|Neurodegeneration is characterized by severe neuronal loss leading to the cognitive and physical impairments that define various neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation is one hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and can ultimately contribute to disease progression. Increased inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Unfortunately, current therapeutic options lack ability to stop or effectively slow progression of these diseases and are primarily aimed at alleviating symptoms. Thus, it is crucial to discover novel treatment candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein first identified in a melanoma cell line. GPNMB augments bone mineral deposition by stimulating osteoblast differentiation. Aside from its anabolic function in the bone, emerging evidence suggests that GPNMB has anti-inflammatory and reparative functions. GPNMB has also been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in an animal model of ALS, cerebral ischemia, and other disease models. Given these discoveries, GPNMB should be investigated as a potential therapeutic option for multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

28674982|t|Motoneuron Disease: Clinical.
28674982|a|ALS is a neurodegenerative disease in which the primary symptoms result in progressive neuromuscular weakness. Recent studies have highlighted that there is significant heterogeneity with regard to anatomical and temporal disease progression. Importantly, more recent advances in genetics have revealed new causative genes to the disease. New efforts have focused on the development of biomarkers that could aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and serve as pharmacodynamics markers. Although traditional pharmaceuticals continue to undergo trials for ALS, new therapeutic strategies including stem cell transplantation studies, gene therapies, and antisense therapies targeting some of the familial forms of ALS are gaining momentum.

35716729|t|Progress in biophysics and molecular biology proteostasis impairment and ALS.
35716729|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that results from the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. It is the most common motor neuron disease and currently has no effective treatment. There is mounting evidence to suggest that disturbances in proteostasis play a significant role in ALS pathogenesis. Proteostasis is the maintenance of the proteome at the right level, conformation and location to allow a cell to perform its intended function. In this review, we present a thorough synthesis of the literature that provides evidence that genetic mutations associated with ALS cause imbalance to a proteome that is vulnerable to such pressure due to its metastable nature. We propose that the mechanism underlying motor neuron death caused by defects in mRNA metabolism and protein degradation pathways converges on proteostasis dysfunction. We propose that the proteostasis network may provide an effective target for therapeutic development in ALS.

30892087|t|Defining pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
30892087|a|Successful treatment of neurodegenerative disease may hinge on early therapeutic intervention. This requires an understanding of early/pre-symptomatic disease, a need that is underscored by advances in antisense oligonucleotide, and viral-vector-based gene therapies. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the study of pre-symptomatic disease requires a cohesive conceptual framework for describing this phase of disease. Informed by the literature in other neurodegenerative diseases and extensive personal experience, a model is proposed that distinguishes ALS as a clinical syndrome from ALS as a disease, and characterizes pre-symptomatic ALS as having two identifiable stages: pre-manifest and prodromal. The unique and critical importance of biomarker development is articulated and an operational definition of phenoconversion is provided. It is hoped that this framework will accelerate collective efforts to study pre-symptomatic ALS, and aid in the design and implementation of an early intervention- or disease-prevention trial.

34874625|t|Microglial TREM2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
34874625|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is an aggressive motor neuron degenerative disease characterized by selective loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. The mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression are poorly understood. The involvement of non-motor neuraxis emphasizes the contribution of glia cells in disease progress. Microglia comprise a unique subset of glial cells and are the principal immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is a surface receptor that, within the CNS, is exclusively expressed on microglia and plays crucial roles in microglial proliferation, migration, activation, metabolism, and phagocytosis. Genetic evidence has linked TREM2 to neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, but its function in ALS pathogenesis is largely unknown. In this review, we summarize how microglial activation, with a specific focus on TREM2 function, affects ALS progression clinically and experimentally. Understanding microglial TREM2 function will help pinpoint the molecular target for ALS treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

32799572|t|Retinoic acid receptor-targeted drugs in neurodegenerative disease.
32799572|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and currently lack effective treatments that block the degenerative process. It has been suggested that retinoids, a class of vitamin A-derived compounds, may hold potential as future therapeutics for these disorders. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we explore the role of retinoids in modulating various signaling pathways in the brain which influence pathologically relevant processes such as cellular differentiation, immune and antioxidant response, neurite outgrowth and neurite regeneration. These actions are predominantly mediated by the retinoic acid receptors and we discuss the developmental history of ligands for these receptors, assessing how refinements in receptor binding specificity and improved pharmacokinetic properties may influence the management of off-target effects. EXPERT OPINION: New approaches to understanding retinoid's mechanisms of action, including non-genomic pathways, and how these mechanisms interact may prove vital in the development of future retinoid-based neurodegenerative disease treatments.

23384285|t|Neural stem cell-based treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.
23384285|a|Human neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by a loss of neurons and glia in the brain or spinal cord. Neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), and stem cell-based cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases have been developed. A recent advance in generation of a new class of pluripotent stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from patients' own skin fibroblasts, opens doors for a totally new field of personalized medicine. Transplantation of NSCs, neurons or glia generated from stem cells in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, HD, ALS and AD, demonstrates clinical improvement and also life extension of these animals. Additional therapeutic benefits in these animals can be provided by stem cell-mediated gene transfer of therapeutic genes such as neurotrophic factors and enzymes. Although further research is still needed, cell and gene therapy based on stem cells, particularly using neurons and glia derived from iPSCs, ESCs or NSCs, will become a routine treatment for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and also stroke and spinal cord injury.

29560813|t|Oligonucleotide therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases.
29560813|a|Therapeutics that directly target RNAs are promising for a broad spectrum of disorders, including the neurodegenerative diseases. This is exemplified by the FDA approval of Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutic for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). RNA targeting therapeutics are currently under development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and spinocerebellar ataxias. We have used an ASO approach toward developing a treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), for targeting the causative gene ATXN2. We demonstrated that reduction of ATXN2 expression in SCA2 mice treated by intracerebroventicular injection (ICV) of ATXN2 ASO delayed motor phenotype onset, improved the expression of several genes demonstrated abnormally reduced by transcriptomic profiling of SCA2 mice, and restored abnormal Purkinje cell firing frequency in acute cerebellar sections. Here we discuss RNA abnormalities in disease and the prospects of targeting neurodegenerative diseases at the level of RNA control using ASOs and other RNA-targeted therapeutics.

31182245|t|Poly(ADP-Ribosylation) in Age-Related Neurological Disease.
31182245|a|A central and causative feature of age-related neurodegenerative disease is the deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain. To devise novel approaches to treatment, regulatory pathways that modulate these aggregation-prone proteins must be defined. One such pathway is post-translational modification by the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which promotes protein recruitment and localization in several cellular contexts. Mounting evidence implicates PAR in seeding the abnormal localization and accumulation of proteins that are causative of neurodegenerative disease. Inhibitors of PAR polymerase (PARP) activity have been developed as cancer therapeutics, raising the possibility that they could be used to treat neurodegenerative disease. We focus on pathways regulated by PAR in neurodegenerative disease, with emphasis on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).

31792092|t|Risks and benefits of unapproved disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disease.
31792092|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients randomized to unapproved, disease-modifying interventions in neurodegenerative disease trials have better outcomes than patients randomized to placebo by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk and benefit experienced by patients in randomized placebo-controlled trials testing investigational treatments for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for results of randomized trials testing non-Food and Drug Administration-approved, putatively disease-modifying interventions from January 2005 to May 2018. Trial characteristics were double-extracted. Coprimary endpoints were the treatment advantage over placebo on efficacy (standardized mean difference in outcomes) and safety (risk ratios of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events), calculated with random effects meta-analyses. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018103798). RESULTS: We included 113 trials (n = 39,875 patients). There was no significant efficacy advantage associated with assignment to putatively disease-modifying interventions compared to placebo for Alzheimer disease (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.01), Parkinson disease (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.15), ALS (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.30), or Huntington disease (0.02, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.31). Patients with Alzheimer disease assigned to active treatment were at higher risk of experiencing serious adverse events (risk ratio [RR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21-1.70). CONCLUSIONS: Assignment to active treatment was not beneficial for any of the indications examined and may have been slightly disadvantageous for patients with Alzheimer disease. Our findings suggest that patients with neurodegenerative diseases are not, on the whole, harmed by assignment to placebo when participating in trials.

34742724|t|Multifaced role of protein deacetylase sirtuins in neurodegenerative disease.
34742724|a|Sirtuins, a class III histone/protein deacetylase, is a central regulator of metabolic function and cellular stress response. This plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndromes, and cardiovascular disease. Sirtuins regulate biological and cellular processes, for instance, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid and fatty acid oxidation, oxidative stress, gene transcriptional activity, apoptosis, inflammatory response, DNA repair mechanism, and autophagic cell degradation, which are known components for the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Emerging evidence suggests that sirtuins are the useful molecular targets against NDDs like, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, the exact mechanism of neuroprotection mediated through sirtuins remains unsettled. The manipulation of sirtuins activity with its modulators, calorie restriction (CR), and micro RNAs (miR) is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of NDDs. Herein, we reviewed the current putative therapeutic role of sirtuins in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, which are mediated through the different molecular phenomenon to prevent neurodegeneration. We also explained the implications of sirtuin modulators, and miR based therapies for the treatment of life-threatening NDDs.

26748651|t|Creatine for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease: end of story?
26748651|a|Creatine (Cr) is a natural compound that plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis. In addition, it ameliorates oxidative stress, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, and apoptosis in vitro as well as in vivo. Since these pathomechanisms are implicated to play a role in several neurodegenerative diseases, Cr supplementation as a neuroprotective strategy has received a lot of attention with several positive animal studies in models of Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This has led to a number of randomized clinical trials (RCT) with oral Cr supplementation, with durations up to 5 years. In this paper, we review the evidence and consequences stemming from these trials. In the case of PD, the initial phase II RCT was promising and led to a large and well-designed phase III trial, which, however, turned out to be negative for all outcome measures. None of the RCTs that have examined effects of Cr in ALS patients showed any clinical benefit. In HD, Cr in high doses (up to 30 g/day) was shown to slow down brain atrophy in premanifest Huntingtin mutation carriers. In spite of this, proof is still lacking that Cr can also have beneficial clinical effects in this group of patients, who will go on to develop HD symptoms. Taken together, the use of Cr supplementation has so far proved disappointing in clinical studies with a number of symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases.

26166612|t|Astrocytes: New Targets for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
26166612|a|The causes of neurodegenerative disorders are multiple, and for most of them a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. However, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson disease (PD) all share common features that include elevated oxidative stress levels and impaired energy metabolism in the nervous system. Most of the current treatments are only successful at alleviating some of the pathological symptoms, but fail at preventing neurodegeneration. There is therefore an urgent need for innovative and more efficient treatments for neurodegenerative disorders. We review here the central role played by astrocytes in the regulation of brain homeostasis, protection and function by supporting neuronal health and activity. In particular, astrocytes are key partners of neuronal metabolism, notably through activation of the astrocyteneuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). They also control the levels of extracellular glutamate, production of antioxidant molecules, disposal of neuronal waste products, storage of energy in the form of glycogen, and expression of neurotrophic factors. These mechanisms, which are key for brain activity and cognition, also largely contribute to neuronal degeneration in pathological situations. Thus, as astrocytes appear to play a key role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders, a growing interest has arisen for astrocytemediated pathways as targets for drugs that aim at treating the root causes of the pathology. We present here the most recent and promising astrocyte-based therapeutic approaches - from fundamental discoveries to clinical trials - that intent to sustain neuronal health and function in neurodegenerative disorders.

24918689|t|Assessment of disease progression and functional benefit in neurodegenerative disease: can we tell the difference?
24918689|a|Therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases include modalities intended to modulate disease progression as well as those whose intent is to improve or maintain functional capacity. As the search for pharmacodynamic markers has proved elusive, treatment outcomes most commonly reflect patient function. As a result, even when clinical trials show a beneficial effect, the underlying etiology of that benefit can be difficult to determine. This review summarizes recent trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease, with the goal of increasing understanding of how the choice of outcome measures influences what can be concluded from the results. Although most ALS trials have been negative in recent years, outcomes are reviewed in terms of potential conclusions that could have been drawn. Functional benefit has been established in a number of recent trials; however, the outcomes used have lead to uncertainty as to whether specific agents modify disease or alter function. In the absence of specific markers sensitive to alteration of disease specific pathways, the distinction between agents that alter underlying disease versus those that affect function may depend on underlying hypotheses rather than clinical trial results.

27830492|t|Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Assessment of Neurodegenerative Disease.
27830492|a|Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that has provided important information about cortical function across an array of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and related extrapyramidal disorders. Application of TMS techniques in neurodegenerative diseases has provided important pathophysiological insights, leading to the development of pathogenic and diagnostic biomarkers that could be used in the clinical setting and therapeutic trials. Abnormalities of TMS outcome measures heralding cortical hyperexcitability, as evidenced by a reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increased in motor-evoked potential amplitude, have been consistently identified as early and intrinsic features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), preceding and correlating with the ensuing neurodegeneration. Cortical hyperexcitability appears to form the pathogenic basis of ALS, mediated by trans-synaptic glutamate-mediated excitotoxic mechanisms. As a consequence of these research findings, TMS has been developed as a potential diagnostic biomarker, capable of identifying upper motor neuronal pathology, at earlier stages of the disease process, and thereby aiding in ALS diagnosis. Of further relevance, marked TMS abnormalities have been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases, which have varied from findings in ALS. With time and greater utilization by clinicians, TMS outcome measures may prove to be of utility in future therapeutic trial settings across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, including the monitoring of neuroprotective, stem-cell, and genetic-based strategies, thereby enabling assessment of biological effectiveness at early stages of drug development.

37657967|t|Therapeutic inhibition of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative disease.
37657967|a|Iron accumulation has been associated with the etiology and progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). The exact role of iron in these diseases is not fully understood, but an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death called ferroptosis could be key. Although there is substantial preclinical and clinical evidence that ferroptosis plays a role in NDD, there are still questions regarding how to target ferroptosis therapeutically, including which proteins to target, identification of clinically relevant biomarkers, and which patients might benefit most. Clinical trials of iron- and ferroptosis-targeted therapies are beginning to provide some answers, but there is growing interest in developing new ferroptosis inhibitors. We describe newly identified ferroptosis targets, opportunities, and challenges in NDD, as well as key considerations for progressing new therapeutics to the clinic.

33223039|t|Is the ALS a motor neuron disease or a hematopoietic stem cell disease?
33223039|a|INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is also known as motor neuron disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a fatal neurodegenerative disease the cause of which is not clear. The effective therapy is absent. ALS is diagnosed through clinical examination and neurophysiologic tests. Clinically, the symptoms manifest when about 80% of motor neurons are dead. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hematopoietic stem cells are isolated through administration of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor from three groups: group 1 of 62 ALS cases, group 2 of 54 ALS-free healthy donors and group 3 of 6 ALS-free ALS-family members. The expression of HLA-DR, CD38, CD117, CD13, CD33, CD56, Thy-1, CD45, SD10, CD71 was assessed in 86 samples of HSCs in ALS group, 61 samples of HSCs in healthy group and 6 samples from ALS-free ALS-family members by the multiparameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: The obtained immunophenotypic profiles of HSCs membrane antigens of the ALS group significantly differ from the ALS-free group, while the immunophenotypic profiles of HSCs membrane antigens of the ALS-family members group are close to the ALS group. DISCUSSION: We suppose that the ALS onset as the disease of HSCs and manifests in the genome and proteome of the HSCs. Such immunophenotypic profiling might permit identification of ALS-specific immune insufficiency and become a tool for early diagnostics of the ALS before clinical manifestation of the disease. New options of the updated therapy of ALS might be developed or corrected considering this new evidence. CONCLUSION: Further research with larger samples and deeper examination is required.

Cell therapy, gene therapy, nanomedicine as choices used to cure neurodegenerative disease. Recently, studies related to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders have been focused on stem cell therapy and Nano-drugs beyond other than regenerative medicine. Hence, by data from experimental models and clinical trials, we review the impact of stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and nanomedicine on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, improved knowledge and continued research on gene therapy and nanomedicine in treating Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lead to advancements in effective and practical treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

31034749|t|Tau tubulin kinases in proteinopathy.
31034749|a|A number of neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau or TDP-43 in disease-affected neurons. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. No disease-modifying therapeutics is available to treat these disorders, and we have a limited understanding of the cellular and molecular factors integral to disease initiation or progression. Phosphorylated tau and TDP-43 are important markers of pathology in dementia disorders and directly contribute to tau- and TDP-43-related neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Here, we review the scope of tau and TDP-43 phosphorylation in neurodegenerative disease and discuss recent work demonstrating the kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2 phosphorylate both tau and TDP-43, promoting neurodegeneration.

36116464|t|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
36116464|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal CNS neurodegenerative disease. Despite intensive research, current management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains suboptimal from diagnosis to prognosis. Recognition of the phenotypic heterogeneity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, global CNS dysfunction, genetic architecture, and development of novel diagnostic criteria is clarifying the spectrum of clinical presentation and facilitating diagnosis. Insights into the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, identification of disease biomarkers and modifiable risks, along with new predictive models, scales, and scoring systems, and a clinical trial pipeline of mechanism-based therapies, are changing the prognostic landscape. Although most recent advances have yet to translate into patient benefit, the idea of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a complex syndrome is already having tangible effects in the clinic. This Seminar will outline these insights and discuss the status of the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for the general neurologist, along with future prospects that could improve care and outcomes for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

36012563|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both characterized by pathogenic protein aggregates that correlate with the progressive degeneration of neurons and the loss of behavioral functions. Both diseases lack biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Proteomics is an unbiased quantitative tool capable of the high throughput quantitation of thousands of proteins from minimal sample volumes. We review recent proteomic studies in human tissues, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and exosomes in ALS and PD that identify proteins with potential utility as biomarkers. Further, we review disease-related post-translational modifications in key proteins TDP43 in ALS and alpha-synuclein in PD studies, which may serve as biomarkers. We compare relative and absolute quantitative proteomic approaches in key biomarker studies in ALS and PD and discuss recent technological advancements which may identify suitable biomarkers for the early-diagnosis treatment efficacy of these diseases.

35653060|t|Antisense Oligonucleotides for the Study and Treatment of ALS.
35653060|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. ALS is now associated with mutations in numerous genes, many of which cause disease in part through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are small sequences of DNA that can reduce expression of a target gene at the post-transcriptional level, making them attractive for neutralizing mutant or toxic gene products. Advancements in the medicinal chemistries of ASOs have improved their pharmacodynamic profile to allow safe and effective delivery to the central nervous system. ASO therapies for ALS have rapidly developed over the last two decades, and ASOs that target SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and ATXN2 are now in clinical trials for familial or sporadic forms of ALS. This review discusses the current state of ASO therapies for ALS, outlining their successes from preclinical development to early clinical trials.

26409694|t|Supporting communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease.
26409694|a|BACKGROUND: Communication supports, referred to as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), are an integral part of medical speech-language pathology practice, yet many providers remain unfamiliar with assessment and intervention principles. For patients with complex communication impairments secondary to neurodegenerative disease, AAC services differ depending on whether their condition primarily affects speech and motor skills (ALS), language (primary progressive aphasia) or cognition (Alzheimer's disease). This review discusses symptom management for these three conditions, identifying behavioral strategies, low- and high-tech solutions for implementation during the natural course of disease. These AAC principles apply to all neurodegenerative diseases in which common symptoms appear. OBJECTIVES: To present AAC interventions for patients with neurodegenerative diseases affecting speech, motor, language and cognitive domains. Three themes emerge: (1) timing of intervention: early referral, regular re-evaluations and continual treatment are essential; (2) communication partners must be included from the onset to establish AAC acceptance and use; and (3) strategies will change over time and use multiple modalities to capitalize on patients' strengths. CONCLUSIONS: AAC should be standard practice for adults with neurodegenerative disease. Patients can maintain effective, functional communication with AAC supports. Individualized communication systems can be implemented ensuring patients remain active participants in daily activities.

32383122|t|Studying ALS: Current Approaches, Effect on Potential Treatment Strategy.
32383122|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by inevitable progressive paralysis. To date, only two disease modifying therapeutic options are available for the patients with ALS, although they show very modest effect on disease course. The main reason of failure in the field of pharmacological correction of ALS is inability to untangle complex relationships taking place during ALS initiation and progression. Traditional methods of research, based on morphology or transgenic animal models studying provided lots of information about ALS throughout the years. However, translation of these results to humans was unsuccessful due to incomplete recapitulation of molecular pathology and overall inadequacy of the models used in the research.In this review we summarize current knowledge regarding ALS molecular pathology with depiction of novel methods applied recently for the studies. Furthermore we describe present and potential treatment strategies that are based on the recent findings in ALS disease mechanisms.

34099897|t|Molecular mechanisms of cell death in neurological diseases.
34099897|a|Tightly orchestrated programmed cell death (PCD) signalling events occur during normal neuronal development in a spatially and temporally restricted manner to establish the neural architecture and shaping the CNS. Abnormalities in PCD signalling cascades, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cell death associated with autophagy as well as in unprogrammed necrosis can be observed in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. These cell deaths can be activated in response to various forms of cellular stress (exerted by intracellular or extracellular stimuli) and inflammatory processes. Aberrant activation of PCD pathways is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, resulting in unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function. Conversely, inactivation of PCD is thought to contribute to the development of brain cancers and to impact their response to therapy. For many neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers current treatment strategies have only modest effect, engendering the need for investigations into the origins of these diseases. With many diseases of the brain displaying aberrations in PCD pathways, it appears that agents that can either inhibit or induce PCD may be critical components of future therapeutic strategies. The development of such therapies will have to be guided by preclinical studies in animal models that faithfully mimic the human disease. In this review, we briefly describe PCD and unprogrammed cell death processes and the roles they play in contributing to neurodegenerative diseases or tumorigenesis in the brain. We also discuss the interplay between distinct cell death signalling cascades and disease pathogenesis and describe pharmacological agents targeting key players in the cell death signalling pathways that have progressed through to clinical trials.

33781562|t|Therapeutic news in ALS.
33781562|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by death of motor neurons in the cortex and the spinal cord. This loss of motor neurons causes progressive weakness and amyotrophy. To date, the median duration of survival in patients with ALS, from first symptoms to death, is estimated to be 36 months. Currently the treatment is limited to two options: riluzole which prolongs survival for a few months and edaravone which is available in only a few countries and also has a small impact on disease progression. There is an urgent need for more effective drugs in this disease to significantly improve progression. Over the last 30 years, all trials have failed to find a curative drug for ALS. This is due, partially, to the heterogeneity of the clinical features and the pathophysiology of motor neuron death. We present in this review the various treatment options currently being developed for ALS, with an emphasis on the range of therapeutic approaches being explored, from old drugs tested in a new indication to innovative drugs obtained via biotechnology or gene therapy.

24510737|t|Rehabilitation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: why it matters.
24510737|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that results in a constellation of problematic symptoms and a high patient and caregiver burden. Multidisciplinary care includes rehabilitation interventions that have the goal of assisting people to teach their fullest potential despite the presence of a disabling disease. Given the progressive nature of ALS, the clinician must be aware of the expected disease trajectory and apply appropriate interventions at each stage. This review will present rehabilitation strategies that can be utilized to maximize patient independence, function, safety, and quality of life, and to minimize disease-related symptoms. The role of bracing, exercise, assistive devices, and adaptive equipment will be discussed. At each disease stage, an experienced rehabilitation team is well positioned to make a significant impact on the life of ALS patients.

32344649|t|Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-Based Neurodegenerative Disease Models for Phenotype Recapitulation and Drug Screening.
32344649|a|Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant unmet medical need in our aging society. There are no effective treatments for most of these diseases, and we know comparatively little regarding pathogenic mechanisms. Among the challenges faced by those involved in developing therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, the syndromes are often complex, and small animal models do not fully recapitulate the unique features of the human nervous system. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a novel technology that ideally would permit us to generate neuronal cells from individual patients, thereby eliminating the problem of species-specificity inherent when using animal models. Specific phenotypes of iPSC-derived cells may permit researchers to identify sub-types and to distinguish among unique clusters and groups. Recently, iPSCs were used for drug screening and testing for neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinocerebellar atrophy (SCA), and Zika virus infection. However, there remain many challenges still ahead, including how one might effectively recapitulate sporadic disease phenotypes and the selection of ideal phenotypes and for large-scale drug screening. Fortunately, quite a few novel strategies have been developed that might be combined with an iPSC-based model to solve these challenges, including organoid technology, single-cell RNA sequencing, genome editing, and deep learning artificial intelligence. Here, we will review current applications and potential future directions for iPSC-based neurodegenerative disease models for critical drug screening.

36543887|t|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a neurodegenerative disorder poised for successful therapeutic translation.
36543887|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease caused by degeneration of motor neurons. As with all major neurodegenerative disorders, development of disease-modifying therapies has proven challenging for multiple reasons. Nevertheless, ALS is one of the few neurodegenerative diseases for which disease-modifying therapies are approved. Significant discoveries and advances have been made in ALS preclinical models, genetics, pathology, biomarkers, imaging and clinical readouts over the last 10-15 years. At the same time, novel therapeutic paradigms are being applied in areas of high unmet medical need, including neurodegenerative disorders. These developments have evolved our knowledge base, allowing identification of targeted candidate therapies for ALS with diverse mechanisms of action. In this Review, we discuss how this advanced knowledge, aligned with new approaches, can enable effective translation of therapeutic agents from preclinical studies through to clinical benefit for patients with ALS. We anticipate that this approach in ALS will also positively impact the field of drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders more broadly.

35659112|t|Tauroursodeoxycholic acid: a potential therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative diseases.
35659112|a|Most neurodegenerative disorders are diseases of protein homeostasis, with misfolded aggregates accumulating. The neurodegenerative process is mediated by numerous metabolic pathways, most of which lead to apoptosis. In recent years, hydrophilic bile acids, particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), have shown important anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities, with numerous experimental and clinical evidence suggesting their possible therapeutic use as disease-modifiers in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental evidence on the mechanisms underlying TUDCA's neuroprotective action derives from animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia. Preclinical studies indicate that TUDCA exerts its effects not only by regulating and inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, but also by reducing oxidative stress, protecting the mitochondria, producing an anti-neuroinflammatory action, and acting as a chemical chaperone to maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. Furthermore, data from phase II clinical trials have shown TUDCA to be safe and a potential disease-modifier in ALS. ALS is the first neurodegenerative disease being treated with hydrophilic bile acids. While further clinical evidence is being accumulated for the other diseases, TUDCA stands as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

28461024|t|Care management in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
28461024|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive weakness of voluntary muscles of movement as well as those for swallowing, speech and respiration. In the absence of curative treatment, care can improve quality of life, prolong survival, and support ALS patients and their families, and also help them to anticipate and prepare for the end of life. Multidisciplinary management in tertiary centers is recommended in close collaboration with general practitioners, home carers and a dedicated health network. Patients' follow-up deals mainly with motor impairment and physical disability, adaptation, nutrition and respiratory function. Involvement of palliative care as part of the multidisciplinary team management offers patients the possibility of discussing their end of life issues. This review summarizes the different aspects of ALS care, from delivering the diagnosis to the end of life, and the organization of its management.

35942674|t|Biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
35942674|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, devastating neurodegenerative disease. Still, the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, and the treatment options are strongly limited. However, the pipeline of potential treatments currently tested in clinical trials is promising. This review will discuss developments in ALS biomarker research and applications within the last 2 years and suggest future directions and needs. RECENT FINDINGS: The diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments, a general marker for axoneuronal degeneration, has been confirmed by further studies in patients with ALS, and neurofilaments are finding their way into routine diagnostic and clinical trials. Additionally, there have been advancements in developing and implementing disease-specific biomarkers, especially in patients with a genetic variant, such as SOD1 or C9orf72. Here, biomarkers have already been used as target markers and outcome parameters for novel treatment approaches. In addition, several novel biomarkers have shown encouraging results but should be discussed in the context of their early stage of assay and clinical establishment. SUMMARY: The first biomarkers have found their way into clinical routine in ALS. In light of an increasing pipeline of potential treatments, further progress in discovering and implementing novel and existing biomarkers is crucial.

35039149|t|Progranulin as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.
35039149|a|Progranulin (PGRN, encoded by the GRN gene) plays a key role in the development, survival, function, and maintenance of neurons and microglia in the mammalian brain. It regulates lysosomal biogenesis, inflammation, repair, stress response, and aging. GRN loss-of-function mutations cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or frontotemporal dementia-GRN (FTD-GRN) in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Mutations that reduce PGRN levels increase the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and limbic-predominant age-related transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy, as well as exacerbate the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and FTD caused by the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. Elevating and/or restoring PGRN levels is an attractive therapeutic strategy and is being investigated for neurodegenerative diseases through multiple mechanisms of action.

28317317|t|The neuroprotective effects of caffeine in neurodegenerative diseases.
28317317|a|Caffeine is the most widely used psychostimulant in Western countries, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), caffeine is beneficial in both men and women, in humans and animals. Similar effects of caffeine were observed in men with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the effect of caffeine in female PD patients is controversial due to caffeine's competition with estrogen for the estrogen-metabolizing enzyme, CYP1A2. Studies conducted in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showed protective effects of A2A R antagonism. A study found caffeine to be associated with earlier age of onset of Huntington's disease (HD) at intakes >190 mg/d, but studies in animal models have found equivocal results. Caffeine is protective in AD and PD at dosages equivalent to 3-5 mg/kg. However, further research is needed to investigate the effects of caffeine on PD in women. As well, the effects of caffeine in ALS, HD and Machado-Joseph disease need to be further investigated. Caffeine's most salient mechanisms of action relevant to neurodegenerative diseases need to be further explored.

31441732|t|Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Potentials, Advances and Limitations.
31441732|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive and uncontrolled gradual loss of motor neurons function or death of neuron cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and the mechanisms underlying their progressive nature remain elusive. There is urgent need to investigate therapeutic strategies and novel treatments for neural regeneration in disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, the development and identification of pluripotent stem cells enabling the acquisition of a large number of neural cells in order to improve cell recovery after neurodegenerative disorders. Pluripotent stem cells which consist of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are characterized by their ability to indefinitely self-renew and the capacity to differentiate into different types of cells. The first human ESC lines were established from donated human embryos; while, because of a limited supply of donor embryos, human ESCs derivation remains ethically and politically controversial. Hence, hiPSCs-based therapies have been shown as an effective replacement for human ESCs without embryo destruction. Compared to the invasive methods for derivation of human ESCs, human iPSCs has opened possible to reprogram patient-specific cells by defined factors and with minimally invasive procedures. Human pluripotent stem cells are a good source for cell-based research, cell replacement therapies and disease modeling. To date, hundreds of human ESC and human iPSC lines have been generated with the aim of treating various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we have highlighted the recent potentials, advances, and limitations of human pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

35585374|t|Design of a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Trial of Tofersen Initiated in Clinically Presymptomatic SOD1 Variant Carriers: the ATLAS Study.
35585374|a|Despite extensive research, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.

34995492|t|Human stem cell models of neurodegeneration: From basic science of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to clinical translation.
34995492|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive cell loss leading to disruption of the structure and function of the central nervous system. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was among the first of these disorders modeled in patient-specific iPSCs, and recent findings have translated into some of the earliest iPSC-inspired clinical trials. Focusing on ALS as an example, we evaluate the status of modeling neurodegenerative diseases using iPSCs, including methods for deriving and using disease-relevant neuronal and glial lineages. We further highlight the remaining challenges in exploiting the full potential of iPSC technology for understanding and potentially treating neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS.

35275534|t|Investigating Casual Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Metabolites, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
35275534|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies had explored that gut microbiota was associated with neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) through the gut-brain axis, among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the underlying causality remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate potential causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases through Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. METHODS: We selected genetic variants associated with gut microbiota traits (N = 18,340) and gut microbiota-derived metabolites (N = 7,824) from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from IGAP (AD, 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls), IPDGC (PD, 37,688 cases; 141,779 controls), and IALSC (ALS, 20,806 cases; 59,804 controls) respectively. RESULTS: Greater abundance of Ruminococcus (OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.103-1.405; p = 0.0004) was found significantly related to higher risk of ALS. Besides, our study found suggestive associations of Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and Lachnoclostridium with AD, of Lentisphaerae, Lentisphaeria, Oxalobacteraceae, Victivallales, Bacillales, Eubacteriumhalliigroup, Anaerostipes, and Clostridiumsensustricto1 with PD, and of Lachnospira, Fusicatenibacter, Catenibacterium, and Ruminococcusgnavusgroup with ALS. Our study also revealed suggestive associations between 12 gut microbiome-dependent metabolites and neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamine was related to lower risk of AD. For the serotonin pathway, serotonin was found as a protective factor of PD, while kynurenine as a risk factor for ALS. CONCLUSION: Our study firstly applied a two-sample MR approach to detect causal relationships among gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings may provide new targets for treatments and may offer valuable insights for further studies on the underlying mechanisms.

36674643|t|Gene Therapy in ALS and SMA: Advances, Challenges and Perspectives.
36674643|a|Gene therapy is defined as the administration of genetic material to modify, manipulate gene expression or alter the properties of living cells for therapeutic purposes. Recent advances and improvements in this field have led to many breakthroughs in the treatment of various diseases. As a result, there has been an increasing interest in the use of these therapies to treat motor neuron diseases (MNDs), for which many potential molecular targets have been discovered. MNDs are neurodegenerative disorders that, in their most severe forms, can lead to respiratory failure and death, for instance, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite the fact that SMA has been known for many years, it is still one of the most common genetic diseases causing infant mortality. The introduction of drugs based on ASOs-nusinersen; small molecules-risdiplam; and replacement therapy (GRT)-Zolgensma has shown a significant improvement in both event-free survival and the quality of life of patients after using these therapies in the available trial results. Although there is still no drug that would effectively alleviate the course of the disease in ALS, the experience gained from SMA gene therapy gives hope for a positive outcome of the efforts to produce an effective and safe drug. The aim of this review is to present current progress and prospects for the use of gene therapy in the treatment of both SMA and ALS.

30576920|t|NRF2 and NF-kB interplay in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic approaches.
30576920|a|Electrophiles and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in modulating cellular defense mechanisms as well as physiological functions, and intracellular signaling. However, excessive ROS generation (endogenous and exogenous) can create a state of redox imbalance leading to cellular and tissue damage (Ma and He, 2012) [1]. A growing body of research data strongly suggests that imbalanced ROS and electrophile overproduction are among the major prodromal factors in the onset and progression of several cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and aging (Ma and He, 2012; Ramsey et al., 2017; Salminen et al., 2012; Sandberg et al., 2014; Sarlette et al., 2008; Tanji et al., 2013) [1-6]. Cells offset oxidative stress by the action of housekeeping antioxidative enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) as well direct and indirect antioxidants (Dinkova-Kostova and Talalay, 2010) [7]. The DNA sequence responsible for modulating the antioxidative and cytoprotective responses of the cells has been identified as the antioxidant response element (ARE), while the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) is the major regulator of the xenobiotic-activated receptor (XAR) responsible for activating the ARE-pathway, thus defined as the NRF2-ARE system (Ma and He, 2012) [1]. In addition, the interplay between the NRF2-ARE system and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB, a protein complex that controls cytokine production and cell survival), has been further investigated in relation to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. On these premises, we provide a review analysis of current understanding of the NRF2-NF-kB interplay, their specific role in major CNS disorders, and consequent therapeutic implication for the treatment of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.

31234550|t|The Potential of Flavonoids for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
31234550|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), currently affect more than 6 million people in the United States. Unfortunately, there are no treatments that slow or prevent disease development and progression. Regardless of the underlying cause of the disorder, age is the strongest risk factor for developing these maladies, suggesting that changes that occur in the aging brain put it at increased risk for neurodegenerative disease development. Moreover, since there are a number of different changes that occur in the aging brain, it is unlikely that targeting a single change is going to be effective for disease treatment. Thus, compounds that have multiple biological activities that can impact the various age-associated changes in the brain that contribute to neurodegenerative disease development and progression are needed. The plant-derived flavonoids have a wide range of activities that could make them particularly effective for blocking the age-associated toxicity pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the evidence for beneficial effects of multiple flavonoids in models of AD, PD, HD, and ALS is presented and common mechanisms of action are identified. Overall, the preclinical data strongly support further investigation of specific flavonoids for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

33652720|t|PERK Pathway and Neurodegenerative Disease: To Inhibit or to Activate?
33652720|a|With the extension of life span in recent decades, there is an increasing burden of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, for which effective treatments are lacking. Neurodegenerative diseases include the widespread Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the less frequent Huntington's disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and also rare early-onset diseases linked to mutations that cause protein aggregation or loss of function in genes that maintain protein homeostasis. The difficulties in applying gene therapy approaches to tackle these diseases is drawing increasing attention to strategies that aim to inhibit cellular toxicity and restore homeostasis by intervening in cellular pathways. These include the unfolded protein response (UPR), activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular affliction that is shared by these diseases. Special focus is turned to the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of the UPR as a target for intervention. However, the complexity of the pathway and its ability to promote cell survival or death, depending on ER stress resolution, has led to some confusion in conflicting studies. Both inhibition and activation of the PERK pathway have been reported to be beneficial in disease models, although there are also some reports where they are counterproductive. Although with the current knowledge a definitive answer cannot be given on whether it is better to activate or to inhibit the pathway, the most encouraging strategies appear to rely on boosting some steps without compromising downstream recovery.

26423934|t|Reverse engineering human neurodegenerative disease using pluripotent stem cell technology.
26423934|a|With the technology of reprogramming somatic cells by introducing defined transcription factors that enables the generation of "induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)" with pluripotency comparable to that of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it has become possible to use this technology to produce various cells and tissues that have been difficult to obtain from living bodies. This advancement is bringing forth rapid progress in iPSC-based disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. More and more studies have demonstrated that phenotypes of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders could be rather faithfully recapitulated in iPSC-derived neural cell cultures. Moreover, despite the adult-onset nature of the diseases, pathogenic phenotypes and cellular abnormalities often exist in early developmental stages, providing new "windows of opportunity" for understanding mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders and for discovering new medicines. The cell reprogramming technology enables a reverse engineering approach for modeling the cellular degenerative phenotypes of a wide range of human disorders. An excellent example is the study of the human neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using iPSCs. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs), culminating in muscle wasting and death from respiratory failure. The iPSC approach provides innovative cell culture platforms to serve as ALS patient-derived model systems. Researchers have converted iPSCs derived from ALS patients into MNs and various types of glial cells, all of which are involved in ALS, to study the disease. The iPSC technology could be used to determine the role of specific genetic factors to track down what's wrong in the neurodegenerative disease process in the "disease-in-a-dish" model. Meanwhile, parallel experiments of targeting the same specific genes in human ESCs could also be performed to control and to complement the iPSC-based approach for ALS disease modeling studies. Much knowledge has been generated from the study of both ALS iPSCs and ESCs. As these methods have advantages and disadvantages that should be balanced on experimental design in order for them to complement one another, combining the diverse methods would help build an expanded knowledge of ALS pathophysiology. The goals are to reverse engineer the human disease using ESCs and iPSCs, generate lineage reporter lines and in vitro disease models, target disease related genes, in order to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of differentiation regulation along neural (neuronal versus glial) lineages, to unravel the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disease, and to provide appropriate cell sources for replacement therapy. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: PSC and the brain.

32230811|t|Role of Alcohol Drinking in Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
32230811|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), increase as the population ages around the world. Environmental factors also play an important role in most cases. Alcohol consumption exists extensively and it acts as one of the environmental factors that promotes these neurodegenerative diseases. The brain is a major target for the actions of alcohol, and heavy alcohol consumption has long been associated with brain damage. Chronic alcohol intake leads to elevated glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and permanent neuronal damage associated with malnutrition. The relationship and contributing mechanisms of alcohol with these three diseases are different. Epidemiological studies have reported a reduction in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in individuals who drink low amounts of alcohol; low or moderate concentrations of ethanol protect against beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity in hippocampal neurons; and excessive amounts of ethanol increase accumulation of Abeta and Tau phosphorylation. Alcohol has been suggested to be either protective of, or not associated with, PD. However, experimental animal studies indicate that chronic heavy alcohol consumption may have dopamine neurotoxic effects through the induction of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and an increase in the amount of alpha-Synuclein (alphaSYN) relevant to PD. The findings on the association between alcohol consumption and ALS are inconsistent; a recent population-based study suggests that alcohol drinking seems to not influence the risk of developing ALS. Additional research is needed to clarify the potential etiological involvement of alcohol intake in causing or resulting in major neurodegenerative diseases, which will eventually lead to potential therapeutics against these alcoholic neurodegenerative diseases.

34677606|t|Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases.
34677606|a|Significant progress has been made in understanding the pre-symptomatic phase of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While much is still unknown, advances in other neurodegenerative diseases offer valuable insights. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that the well-recognized clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), spinal muscular atrophy, and frontotemporal dementia are also each preceded by a pre-symptomatic or prodromal period of varying duration, during which the underlying disease process unfolds, with associated compensatory changes and loss of inherent system redundancy. Key insights from these diseases highlight opportunities for discovery in ALS. The development of biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau has led to a shift in defining AD based on inferred underlying histopathology. PD is unique among neurodegenerative diseases in the number and diversity of non-genetic biomarkers of pre-symptomatic disease, most notably REM-sleep behavior disorder. HD benefits from an ability to predict the likely timing of clinically manifest disease based on age and CAG-repeat length alongside reliable neuroimaging markers of atrophy. SMA clinical trials have highlighted the transformational value of early therapeutic intervention, and studies in FTD illustrate the differential role of biomarkers based on genotype. Similar advances in ALS would transform our understanding of key events in pathogenesis, thereby dramatically accelerating progress towards disease prevention. Deciphering the biology of pre-symptomatic ALS relies upon a clear conceptual framework for defining the earliest stages of disease. Clinically manifest ALS may emerge abruptly, especially among those who harbor genetic mutations associated with rapidly progressive ALS. However, the disease may also evolve more gradually, revealing a prodromal period of mild motor impairment preceding phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Similarly, cognitive and behavioral impairment, when present, may emerge gradually, evolving through a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment or mild behavioral impairment before progression to ALS. Biomarkers are critically important to studying pre-symptomatic ALS and essential to efforts to intervene therapeutically before clinically manifest disease emerges. The use of non-genetic biomarkers, however, presents challenges related to counseling, informed consent, communication of results, and limited protections afforded by existing legislation. Experiences from pre-symptomatic genetic testing and counseling, and the legal protections against discrimination based on genetic data, may serve as a guide. Building upon what we have learned-more broadly from other pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases and specifically from ALS gene mutation carriers-we present a roadmap to early intervention, and perhaps even disease prevention, for all forms of ALS.

33918092|t|The Links between ALS and NF-kappaB.
33918092|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease wherein motor neuron degeneration leads to muscle weakness, progressive paralysis, and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Currently, the cause of ALS is unknown but, as with several neurodegenerative diseases, the potential role of neuroinflammation has become an increasingly popular hypothesis in ALS research. Indeed, upregulation of neuroinflammatory factors have been observed in both ALS patients and animal models. One such factor is the inflammatory inducer NF-kappaB. Besides its connection to inflammation, NF-kappaB activity can be linked to several genes associated to familial forms of ALS, and many of the environmental risk factors of the disease stimulate NF-kappaB activation. Collectively, this has led many to hypothesize that NF-kappaB proteins may play a role in ALS pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the genetic and environmental connections between NF-kappaB and ALS, as well as how this pathway may affect different CNS cell types, and finally how this may lead to motor neuron degeneration.

28856541|t|Glycoprotein NMB: an Emerging Role in Neurodegenerative Disease.
28856541|a|Neurodegeneration is characterized by severe neuronal loss leading to the cognitive and physical impairments that define various neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation is one hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and can ultimately contribute to disease progression. Increased inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Unfortunately, current therapeutic options lack ability to stop or effectively slow progression of these diseases and are primarily aimed at alleviating symptoms. Thus, it is crucial to discover novel treatment candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein first identified in a melanoma cell line. GPNMB augments bone mineral deposition by stimulating osteoblast differentiation. Aside from its anabolic function in the bone, emerging evidence suggests that GPNMB has anti-inflammatory and reparative functions. GPNMB has also been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in an animal model of ALS, cerebral ischemia, and other disease models. Given these discoveries, GPNMB should be investigated as a potential therapeutic option for multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

28674982|t|Motoneuron Disease: Clinical.
28674982|a|ALS is a neurodegenerative disease in which the primary symptoms result in progressive neuromuscular weakness. Recent studies have highlighted that there is significant heterogeneity with regard to anatomical and temporal disease progression. Importantly, more recent advances in genetics have revealed new causative genes to the disease. New efforts have focused on the development of biomarkers that could aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and serve as pharmacodynamics markers. Although traditional pharmaceuticals continue to undergo trials for ALS, new therapeutic strategies including stem cell transplantation studies, gene therapies, and antisense therapies targeting some of the familial forms of ALS are gaining momentum.

35716729|t|Progress in biophysics and molecular biology proteostasis impairment and ALS.
35716729|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that results from the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. It is the most common motor neuron disease and currently has no effective treatment. There is mounting evidence to suggest that disturbances in proteostasis play a significant role in ALS pathogenesis. Proteostasis is the maintenance of the proteome at the right level, conformation and location to allow a cell to perform its intended function. In this review, we present a thorough synthesis of the literature that provides evidence that genetic mutations associated with ALS cause imbalance to a proteome that is vulnerable to such pressure due to its metastable nature. We propose that the mechanism underlying motor neuron death caused by defects in mRNA metabolism and protein degradation pathways converges on proteostasis dysfunction. We propose that the proteostasis network may provide an effective target for therapeutic development in ALS.

30892087|t|Defining pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
30892087|a|Successful treatment of neurodegenerative disease may hinge on early therapeutic intervention. This requires an understanding of early/pre-symptomatic disease, a need that is underscored by advances in antisense oligonucleotide, and viral-vector-based gene therapies. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the study of pre-symptomatic disease requires a cohesive conceptual framework for describing this phase of disease. Informed by the literature in other neurodegenerative diseases and extensive personal experience, a model is proposed that distinguishes ALS as a clinical syndrome from ALS as a disease, and characterizes pre-symptomatic ALS as having two identifiable stages: pre-manifest and prodromal. The unique and critical importance of biomarker development is articulated and an operational definition of phenoconversion is provided. It is hoped that this framework will accelerate collective efforts to study pre-symptomatic ALS, and aid in the design and implementation of an early intervention- or disease-prevention trial.

37015866|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads some people with the disease to consider medical assistance in dying (MAiD). In this article, we describe how a variety of moral problems can emerge from this particular context and affect the well-being of people with ALS, their loved ones, and their caregivers. As MAiD is framed by specific eligibility criteria, broadening its eligibility is often proposed to address these issues. This critical review of the literature aims to identify moral issues relating to ALS that may persist or arise in the event of such widening. The MEDLINE, EMBASE CINAHL and Web of Science databases were searched using 4 search combinations to capture insights from existing literature on ethics, MAiD and ALS (N=41). A thematic content analysis highlighted 3 contextual categories where moral issues emerge (the experience of the disease, the choice of how to die, and the implementation of MAiD). Two important observations are discussed: 1) there are differences in perspective between stakeholders, which can lead to disagreement, but some similarities of perspective also exist; 2) the widening of MAiD eligibility mainly concerns moral issues related to the choice of how to die, and thus constitutes a partial solution to the problems identified.

34874625|t|Microglial TREM2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
34874625|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is an aggressive motor neuron degenerative disease characterized by selective loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. The mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression are poorly understood. The involvement of non-motor neuraxis emphasizes the contribution of glia cells in disease progress. Microglia comprise a unique subset of glial cells and are the principal immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is a surface receptor that, within the CNS, is exclusively expressed on microglia and plays crucial roles in microglial proliferation, migration, activation, metabolism, and phagocytosis. Genetic evidence has linked TREM2 to neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, but its function in ALS pathogenesis is largely unknown. In this review, we summarize how microglial activation, with a specific focus on TREM2 function, affects ALS progression clinically and experimentally. Understanding microglial TREM2 function will help pinpoint the molecular target for ALS treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

32799572|t|Retinoic acid receptor-targeted drugs in neurodegenerative disease.
32799572|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and currently lack effective treatments that block the degenerative process. It has been suggested that retinoids, a class of vitamin A-derived compounds, may hold potential as future therapeutics for these disorders. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we explore the role of retinoids in modulating various signaling pathways in the brain which influence pathologically relevant processes such as cellular differentiation, immune and antioxidant response, neurite outgrowth and neurite regeneration. These actions are predominantly mediated by the retinoic acid receptors and we discuss the developmental history of ligands for these receptors, assessing how refinements in receptor binding specificity and improved pharmacokinetic properties may influence the management of off-target effects. EXPERT OPINION: New approaches to understanding retinoid's mechanisms of action, including non-genomic pathways, and how these mechanisms interact may prove vital in the development of future retinoid-based neurodegenerative disease treatments.

23384285|t|Neural stem cell-based treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.
23384285|a|Human neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by a loss of neurons and glia in the brain or spinal cord. Neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), and stem cell-based cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases have been developed. A recent advance in generation of a new class of pluripotent stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from patients' own skin fibroblasts, opens doors for a totally new field of personalized medicine. Transplantation of NSCs, neurons or glia generated from stem cells in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, HD, ALS and AD, demonstrates clinical improvement and also life extension of these animals. Additional therapeutic benefits in these animals can be provided by stem cell-mediated gene transfer of therapeutic genes such as neurotrophic factors and enzymes. Although further research is still needed, cell and gene therapy based on stem cells, particularly using neurons and glia derived from iPSCs, ESCs or NSCs, will become a routine treatment for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases and also stroke and spinal cord injury.

29560813|t|Oligonucleotide therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases.
29560813|a|Therapeutics that directly target RNAs are promising for a broad spectrum of disorders, including the neurodegenerative diseases. This is exemplified by the FDA approval of Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutic for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). RNA targeting therapeutics are currently under development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and spinocerebellar ataxias. We have used an ASO approach toward developing a treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), for targeting the causative gene ATXN2. We demonstrated that reduction of ATXN2 expression in SCA2 mice treated by intracerebroventicular injection (ICV) of ATXN2 ASO delayed motor phenotype onset, improved the expression of several genes demonstrated abnormally reduced by transcriptomic profiling of SCA2 mice, and restored abnormal Purkinje cell firing frequency in acute cerebellar sections. Here we discuss RNA abnormalities in disease and the prospects of targeting neurodegenerative diseases at the level of RNA control using ASOs and other RNA-targeted therapeutics.

31182245|t|Poly(ADP-Ribosylation) in Age-Related Neurological Disease.
31182245|a|A central and causative feature of age-related neurodegenerative disease is the deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain. To devise novel approaches to treatment, regulatory pathways that modulate these aggregation-prone proteins must be defined. One such pathway is post-translational modification by the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which promotes protein recruitment and localization in several cellular contexts. Mounting evidence implicates PAR in seeding the abnormal localization and accumulation of proteins that are causative of neurodegenerative disease. Inhibitors of PAR polymerase (PARP) activity have been developed as cancer therapeutics, raising the possibility that they could be used to treat neurodegenerative disease. We focus on pathways regulated by PAR in neurodegenerative disease, with emphasis on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).

31792092|t|Risks and benefits of unapproved disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disease.
31792092|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients randomized to unapproved, disease-modifying interventions in neurodegenerative disease trials have better outcomes than patients randomized to placebo by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk and benefit experienced by patients in randomized placebo-controlled trials testing investigational treatments for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for results of randomized trials testing non-Food and Drug Administration-approved, putatively disease-modifying interventions from January 2005 to May 2018. Trial characteristics were double-extracted. Coprimary endpoints were the treatment advantage over placebo on efficacy (standardized mean difference in outcomes) and safety (risk ratios of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events), calculated with random effects meta-analyses. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018103798). RESULTS: We included 113 trials (n = 39,875 patients). There was no significant efficacy advantage associated with assignment to putatively disease-modifying interventions compared to placebo for Alzheimer disease (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.01), Parkinson disease (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.15), ALS (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.30), or Huntington disease (0.02, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.31). Patients with Alzheimer disease assigned to active treatment were at higher risk of experiencing serious adverse events (risk ratio [RR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21-1.70). CONCLUSIONS: Assignment to active treatment was not beneficial for any of the indications examined and may have been slightly disadvantageous for patients with Alzheimer disease. Our findings suggest that patients with neurodegenerative diseases are not, on the whole, harmed by assignment to placebo when participating in trials.

34742724|t|Multifaced role of protein deacetylase sirtuins in neurodegenerative disease.
34742724|a|Sirtuins, a class III histone/protein deacetylase, is a central regulator of metabolic function and cellular stress response. This plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndromes, and cardiovascular disease. Sirtuins regulate biological and cellular processes, for instance, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid and fatty acid oxidation, oxidative stress, gene transcriptional activity, apoptosis, inflammatory response, DNA repair mechanism, and autophagic cell degradation, which are known components for the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Emerging evidence suggests that sirtuins are the useful molecular targets against NDDs like, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, the exact mechanism of neuroprotection mediated through sirtuins remains unsettled. The manipulation of sirtuins activity with its modulators, calorie restriction (CR), and micro RNAs (miR) is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of NDDs. Herein, we reviewed the current putative therapeutic role of sirtuins in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, which are mediated through the different molecular phenomenon to prevent neurodegeneration. We also explained the implications of sirtuin modulators, and miR based therapies for the treatment of life-threatening NDDs.

26748651|t|Creatine for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease: end of story?
26748651|a|Creatine (Cr) is a natural compound that plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis. In addition, it ameliorates oxidative stress, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, and apoptosis in vitro as well as in vivo. Since these pathomechanisms are implicated to play a role in several neurodegenerative diseases, Cr supplementation as a neuroprotective strategy has received a lot of attention with several positive animal studies in models of Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This has led to a number of randomized clinical trials (RCT) with oral Cr supplementation, with durations up to 5 years. In this paper, we review the evidence and consequences stemming from these trials. In the case of PD, the initial phase II RCT was promising and led to a large and well-designed phase III trial, which, however, turned out to be negative for all outcome measures. None of the RCTs that have examined effects of Cr in ALS patients showed any clinical benefit. In HD, Cr in high doses (up to 30 g/day) was shown to slow down brain atrophy in premanifest Huntingtin mutation carriers. In spite of this, proof is still lacking that Cr can also have beneficial clinical effects in this group of patients, who will go on to develop HD symptoms. Taken together, the use of Cr supplementation has so far proved disappointing in clinical studies with a number of symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases.

26166612|t|Astrocytes: New Targets for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
26166612|a|The causes of neurodegenerative disorders are multiple, and for most of them a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. However, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson disease (PD) all share common features that include elevated oxidative stress levels and impaired energy metabolism in the nervous system. Most of the current treatments are only successful at alleviating some of the pathological symptoms, but fail at preventing neurodegeneration. There is therefore an urgent need for innovative and more efficient treatments for neurodegenerative disorders. We review here the central role played by astrocytes in the regulation of brain homeostasis, protection and function by supporting neuronal health and activity. In particular, astrocytes are key partners of neuronal metabolism, notably through activation of the astrocyteneuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). They also control the levels of extracellular glutamate, production of antioxidant molecules, disposal of neuronal waste products, storage of energy in the form of glycogen, and expression of neurotrophic factors. These mechanisms, which are key for brain activity and cognition, also largely contribute to neuronal degeneration in pathological situations. Thus, as astrocytes appear to play a key role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders, a growing interest has arisen for astrocytemediated pathways as targets for drugs that aim at treating the root causes of the pathology. We present here the most recent and promising astrocyte-based therapeutic approaches - from fundamental discoveries to clinical trials - that intent to sustain neuronal health and function in neurodegenerative disorders.

24918689|t|Assessment of disease progression and functional benefit in neurodegenerative disease: can we tell the difference?
24918689|a|Therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases include modalities intended to modulate disease progression as well as those whose intent is to improve or maintain functional capacity. As the search for pharmacodynamic markers has proved elusive, treatment outcomes most commonly reflect patient function. As a result, even when clinical trials show a beneficial effect, the underlying etiology of that benefit can be difficult to determine. This review summarizes recent trials in ALS and Parkinson's disease, with the goal of increasing understanding of how the choice of outcome measures influences what can be concluded from the results. Although most ALS trials have been negative in recent years, outcomes are reviewed in terms of potential conclusions that could have been drawn. Functional benefit has been established in a number of recent trials; however, the outcomes used have lead to uncertainty as to whether specific agents modify disease or alter function. In the absence of specific markers sensitive to alteration of disease specific pathways, the distinction between agents that alter underlying disease versus those that affect function may depend on underlying hypotheses rather than clinical trial results.

27830492|t|Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Assessment of Neurodegenerative Disease.
27830492|a|Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that has provided important information about cortical function across an array of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and related extrapyramidal disorders. Application of TMS techniques in neurodegenerative diseases has provided important pathophysiological insights, leading to the development of pathogenic and diagnostic biomarkers that could be used in the clinical setting and therapeutic trials. Abnormalities of TMS outcome measures heralding cortical hyperexcitability, as evidenced by a reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increased in motor-evoked potential amplitude, have been consistently identified as early and intrinsic features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), preceding and correlating with the ensuing neurodegeneration. Cortical hyperexcitability appears to form the pathogenic basis of ALS, mediated by trans-synaptic glutamate-mediated excitotoxic mechanisms. As a consequence of these research findings, TMS has been developed as a potential diagnostic biomarker, capable of identifying upper motor neuronal pathology, at earlier stages of the disease process, and thereby aiding in ALS diagnosis. Of further relevance, marked TMS abnormalities have been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases, which have varied from findings in ALS. With time and greater utilization by clinicians, TMS outcome measures may prove to be of utility in future therapeutic trial settings across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, including the monitoring of neuroprotective, stem-cell, and genetic-based strategies, thereby enabling assessment of biological effectiveness at early stages of drug development.

37657967|t|Therapeutic inhibition of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative disease.
37657967|a|Iron accumulation has been associated with the etiology and progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). The exact role of iron in these diseases is not fully understood, but an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death called ferroptosis could be key. Although there is substantial preclinical and clinical evidence that ferroptosis plays a role in NDD, there are still questions regarding how to target ferroptosis therapeutically, including which proteins to target, identification of clinically relevant biomarkers, and which patients might benefit most. Clinical trials of iron- and ferroptosis-targeted therapies are beginning to provide some answers, but there is growing interest in developing new ferroptosis inhibitors. We describe newly identified ferroptosis targets, opportunities, and challenges in NDD, as well as key considerations for progressing new therapeutics to the clinic.

33223039|t|Is the ALS a motor neuron disease or a hematopoietic stem cell disease?
33223039|a|INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is also known as motor neuron disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a fatal neurodegenerative disease the cause of which is not clear. The effective therapy is absent. ALS is diagnosed through clinical examination and neurophysiologic tests. Clinically, the symptoms manifest when about 80% of motor neurons are dead. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hematopoietic stem cells are isolated through administration of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor from three groups: group 1 of 62 ALS cases, group 2 of 54 ALS-free healthy donors and group 3 of 6 ALS-free ALS-family members. The expression of HLA-DR, CD38, CD117, CD13, CD33, CD56, Thy-1, CD45, SD10, CD71 was assessed in 86 samples of HSCs in ALS group, 61 samples of HSCs in healthy group and 6 samples from ALS-free ALS-family members by the multiparameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: The obtained immunophenotypic profiles of HSCs membrane antigens of the ALS group significantly differ from the ALS-free group, while the immunophenotypic profiles of HSCs membrane antigens of the ALS-family members group are close to the ALS group. DISCUSSION: We suppose that the ALS onset as the disease of HSCs and manifests in the genome and proteome of the HSCs. Such immunophenotypic profiling might permit identification of ALS-specific immune insufficiency and become a tool for early diagnostics of the ALS before clinical manifestation of the disease. New options of the updated therapy of ALS might be developed or corrected considering this new evidence. CONCLUSION: Further research with larger samples and deeper examination is required.

36527565|t|Regenerative medicine improve neurodegenerative diseases.
36527565|a|Regenerative medicine is a subdivision of medicine that improves methods to regrow, repair or replace unhealthy cells and tissues to return to normal function. Cell therapy, gene therapy, nanomedicine as choices used to cure neurodegenerative disease. Recently, studies related to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders have been focused on stem cell therapy and Nano-drugs beyond other than regenerative medicine. Hence, by data from experimental models and clinical trials, we review the impact of stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and nanomedicine on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, improved knowledge and continued research on gene therapy and nanomedicine in treating Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lead to advancements in effective and practical treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

31034749|t|Tau tubulin kinases in proteinopathy.
31034749|a|A number of neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau or TDP-43 in disease-affected neurons. These diseases include Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. No disease-modifying therapeutics is available to treat these disorders, and we have a limited understanding of the cellular and molecular factors integral to disease initiation or progression. Phosphorylated tau and TDP-43 are important markers of pathology in dementia disorders and directly contribute to tau- and TDP-43-related neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Here, we review the scope of tau and TDP-43 phosphorylation in neurodegenerative disease and discuss recent work demonstrating the kinases TTBK1 and TTBK2 phosphorylate both tau and TDP-43, promoting neurodegeneration.
